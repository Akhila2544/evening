<p> <q>A lion (Panthera leo), or lioness for females, is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India.</q> It has a muscular, broad-chested body; short, rounded head; round ears; and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. <blockquote>A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs</blockquote>.Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator; although some lions scavenge when opportunities occur and have been known to hunt humans, lions typically don't actively seek out and prey on humans.</p>

<p> <q>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, it primarily preys on ungulates, such as deer and wild boar. </q>It is territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring large contiguous areas of habitat to support its requirements for prey and rearing of its offspring. <!--Tiger cubs stay with their mother for about two years and then become independent, leaving their mother's home range to establish their own.--></p>

<p> <q>A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back.</q> Camels have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food (milk and meat) and textiles (fiber and felt from hair). <blockquote>Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitat and are a vital means of transport for passengers and cargo</blockquote> There are three surviving species of camel. The one-humped dromedary makes up 94% of the world's camel population, and the two-humped Bactrian camel makes up 6%. The Wild Bactrian camel is a separate species and is now critically endangered.</p>

<p> <blockquote>Elephants are the largest existing land animals.</blockquote> Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant. They are the only surviving members of the family Elephantidae and the order Proboscidea. The order was formerly much more diverse during the Pleistocene, but most species became extinct during the Late Pleistocene epoch. <q>Distinctive features of elephants include a long proboscis called a trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, pillar-like legs, and tough but sensitive skin</q>. The trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in communication. <q>African elephants have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller ears, and convex or level backs.</q></p>
